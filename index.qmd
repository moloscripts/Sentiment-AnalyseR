## Context
This code is part of my Msc project in Master of Science in Computer Science at the University of Nairobi.

## Introduction

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are widely used for  Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks because they're good at learning patterns in sequential data such as text.^[[1](https://www.kaggle.com/code/yashvmohod/coding-11-imdb-sentiment-analysis-with-lstm){target="_blank"}]^ LSTM stands for Long Short Term Memory.  Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
